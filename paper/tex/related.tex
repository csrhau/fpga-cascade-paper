\section{Related Work}

Other approaches have been propsed to streaming sencil codes for FPGAs.
Kano et al~\cite{sano:2014aa} propose the SCC array, a custom computational machine (CCM) which is worryingly similar to cascade.



Implementing the SSA is conceptually very simple.
Each processing element contains a shift-buffer $B$ of width $2r$, and the stencil computation is reformulated as $f(B_0, B_{r-1}, B_{r}, B_{r+1}, B{2r})$
