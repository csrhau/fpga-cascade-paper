\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces CASTLE, an architectural design pattern for hardware implementations of stencil codes.
CASTLE allows developers to take advantage of the massive parallelism offered by FPGAs.

with bidirectional communication between neighbors.
We propose a sliding window decomposition scheme which reduces the number of discrete communication events.

Domain decomposition system architecture co-design.
